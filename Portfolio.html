      This song was created during my first summer session as an MAT student for a group art installation project. Each member of our group was responsible for producing a drum and bass (DnB) track, a genre I had very little experience working with. 
      At first, it was hard to find direction. I knew what my song should sound like, but I didn't know what I wanted it to sound like. Through perseverance and collaboration with my groupmates, 
      I began to understand the elements of DnB. Slowly, I was able to find my creative rhythm through this track and create the final product. The track was produced using Logic Pro, a software I am still learning how to navigate. While my workflow for this project was not entirely a smooth sail, this was definitely a learning experience, both technically and creatively. The track went on to soundtrack my group's art installation, tying together the visual and spatial aspects of our project.

      The Interface Desk Shelf is an innovative solution born out of a constant issue I faced as a bedroom musician: the instability of audio interfaces caused by the pull of heavy guitar and instrument cables. During recording sessions, my interface was prone to being yanked off my desk by the cable connecting my instruments to my computer, disrupting my workflow and risking potential equipment damage. This 3D-printed product is designed specifically to securely hold a small 175 x 47.5 x 98.8 mm interface in place while also helping users maintain an organized and neat workspace.
      The design allows for quick and easy access to the interface and all its inputs, knobs, and buttons, and also includes a lower storage compartment for things like picks, cables, capos, or adapters. Anchors on the top platform ensure that the interface remains firmly in place during use, even when tension is applied to the connected cables. The minimalistic yet functional approach to this design makes this product ideal for compact setups, where space is limited and efficiency is essential. With this product, I aimed to create a solution that enhances both the accessibility and efficiency of this audio and home studio essential.

    <h1>Beats Parody Commercial</h1>

      This quick parody ad project was the product of a cinematography course, where students were tasked to write, direct, and shoot a mock commercial using all of the skills and techniques that we had learned and developed throughout the semester. 
      The production came together through a mix of collaboration with my fellow classmates and careful planning, along with a bit of inexperience and a little fear. This marked my first time fully writing and directing a film project of any kind. This was co-directed, edited, and written all by myself, making it both an exciting and intimidating mark in my creative journey thus far. 
      To bring the concept to life, I developed an outline to establish the flow of the video, a lookbook to establish the visual style and gather aesthetic inspiration, and a shot list to ensure organization and efficiency during the production process. 
      The decision to parody Beats headphones was inspired by my love for musical media. I saw this as an opportunity to create a music video for the first time, using elements of rhythm, energy, and humor to showcase my creativity. 
      The experience challenged me to lead a crew for the first time, work with time/resource constraints, think visually, and adapt quickly. In the end, I was able to deliver with the help of my peers. This project reflects my growth as a filmmaker and my courage in taking initiative.
