    <p>     ...going wherever the wind takes me</p>
    <p>University of California, Santa Barbara</p>
    <p>B.A. in Film and Media Studies — Minor in Music & Media Arts and Design</p>
    <p>My creative journey began in a world of fandoms and boy bands, where my passion as a young fangirl sparked a love for storytelling, video editing, visual media, and sound design. Now at 21, I’m an aspiring photographer, videographer, editor, musician, and overall creative. I am a Film and Media student at the University of California of Santa Barbara, also pursuing minors in Music and Media Art & Design. My specialties within filmmaking lie in editing, post-production, sound design, and boom operation, with additional experience in screenwriting and BTS photography. I document moments in life through vlog-style videos on my YouTube channel, whilst also sharing my progress as a filmmaker with my student projects on the channel as well. My photography spans from casual nights out to live shows to professional graduation shoots. As a self-taught guitarist, I share music covers on Instagram and am diving into the world of music production and songwriting. At my core, I want to turn the skills I developed while running fan accounts and promoting my favorite artists as a teenager into a meaningful career in the music or entertainment industry. Whether it's through visuals, sound, or storytelling, I aim to make art that connects people, inspires other fans, and reflects the same passion my younger self had.
